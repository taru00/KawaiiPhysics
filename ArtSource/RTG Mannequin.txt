Do +/- for the opposite side

Shoulder
-50

Lower Arm
30

Hips
5

If your feet aren't touching 
the ground all the way you can 
click the middle hip sphere
in between where I move the hips 
by 5 degrees. There should only be 1 sphere, 
not 1 for each side. Click on it. Then toward the 
top directly underneath "Delete Pose" click on the symbol 
to the right of the mouse icon. You should be able to move the 
hips up/down now. Any mistakes you make you want to undo just press
Ctrl+Z.
